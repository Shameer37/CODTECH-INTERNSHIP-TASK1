## Overview of the Project

### Project: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR GAME PLAYING

### Objective
The objective of this project is implementing and training an Reinforcement Learning model to play  Taxi game .The agent (taxi) must pick up passengers from one location and drop them off at a designated destination

### Key Activities
- **Passenger States** :  The state space of the environment includes the location of the passenger and the destination.
- **Actions** : The taxi can perform actions related to passenger handling .Actions like pickup and dropoff
- **Positive Reward** :  Given for successfully picking up and dropping off the passenger at the correct location.
- **Negative Reward** : Penalizes the taxi for incorrect actions or if the passenger is dropped off at the wrong location

### Technologies Used
- **Python** : Python is used for writing the code due to its rich ecosystem of libraries for data science, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.
- **OpenAI Gym** : gym is used to provide the Taxi-v3 environment. It is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **NumPy** : numpy is used for numerical operations, particularly for handling arrays and performing calculations like updating the Q-table.
- **Matplotlib** : matplotlib is used for rendering and displaying images of the game environment. It helps in visualizing the agentâ€™s actions and states.
- **IPython** : IPython.display is used for clearing output and dynamically displaying images in Jupyter Notebooks.
